# Requirements Prioritization in Scaled Agile Distributed Software Development

### Week 5 Lecture

## Understanding Requirements

- **Definition:**
  - Focus on **what** is needed, not **how** it will be implemented.
  - Address user needs to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
  - **IEEE Definition:** A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.

- **Importance:**
  - Requirements capture the essential needs of users.
  - Serve as a foundation for system development.

## Requirements Engineering (RE)

- **Definition:**
  - A branch of Software Engineering focused on discovering, specifying, analyzing, and documenting system requirements.

- **RE Processes:**
  1. **Requirements Elicitation, Analysis, and Prioritization**
     - Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
     - Understanding and analyzing needs.
     - Prioritizing based on importance and feasibility.
  2. **Requirements Specification**
     - Documenting requirements in a clear and detailed manner.
  3. **Requirements Validation**
     - Ensuring requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs.
  4. **Requirements Management**
     - Handling changes and maintaining consistency over time.

## RE in Software Development Methods

### Classic Development Methods (e.g., Waterfall)

- Requirements are fully defined and documented before development begins.
- Emphasizes thorough planning and documentation.

### Agile Development (e.g., Scrum)

- Requirements evolve iteratively throughout the development process.
- Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer involvement.

## Requirements Prioritization in Scaled Agile Distributed Development

- **Context:**
  - Adoption of Agile methods at the enterprise level.
  - Use of scaling Agile frameworks (e.g., Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD), Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)).

- **Importance:**
  - Prioritization extends beyond individual teams.
  - Involves multiple decision-making levels to align with business strategy.

### Key Decision-Making Levels

1. **Portfolio Level**
2. **Domain/Program Level**
3. **Team Level**

## Decision-Making at Different Levels

### Portfolio Level

- **Objectives:**
  - Define and prioritize business goals aligned with the organization's strategy.
  - Formalize High-Level Requirements (HLRs) to achieve these goals.
  - Allocate HLRs to engineering for implementation.

- **Practices:**
  - **Inter-Iteration Prioritization:** Prioritize across multiple iterations.
  - **Portfolio Management Team:** Cross-functional team for decision-making.
  - **Continuous Decision-Making:** Regular check-ins (quarterly, monthly, fortnightly) and ad-hoc meetings.
  - **Quantitative & Qualitative Approaches:** Use data and expert judgment.

### Domain/Program Level

- **Role:**
  - Acts as a bridge between portfolio and team levels.
  - Handles domain-specific requirements.

- **Responsibilities:**

  **First Part:**
  - Initial decision-making on HLRs from each domain.
  - Contributes to forming strategic themes.
  - Supported by **Intra-Iteration Prioritization**.

  **Second Part:**
  - **Inter-Iteration Prioritization** across teams.
  - Decompose HLRs into implementable tasks for short development cycles.

### Team Level

- **Focus:**
  - Detailed prioritization within the team.
  - Utilize basic Agile methods for decision-making (e.g., Scrum).

- **Practices:**
  - **Intra-Iteration Prioritization:** Adjust priorities within sprints.
  - Create detailed requirements (e.g., user stories).
  - Make priority decisions collaboratively within the team.

## Boundary Spanning Mechanisms

- **Definition:**
  - Activities that connect groups separated by location, hierarchy, or function.

- **Purpose:**
  - Facilitate knowledge sharing, negotiation, consensus building, and conflict resolution.
  - Essential for effective prioritization across distributed teams.

- **Mechanisms:**
  1. **Boundary Spanning Events:**
     - Meetings, workshops, and planning sessions.
  2. **Boundary Spanning Artefacts:**
     - Shared documents, models, and tools.
  3. **Boundary Spanner Roles:**
     - Individuals who act as liaisons (e.g., product owners, scrum masters).

## Collaborative Technologies (CTs) in Decision-Making

- **Purpose:**
  - Enable collaboration among distributed team members.
  - Support shared understanding of requirement priorities.

- **Types of CTs:**

  **Synchronous Tools:**
  - Real-time communication.
  - Examples: MS Teams, video conferencing.

  **Asynchronous Tools:**
  - Communication over time.
  - Examples: Email, Confluence, Jira.

- **Common Tools:**
  - Spreadsheets
  - Jira
  - AHA!
  - Azure DevOps (ADO)
  - Confluence
  - PowerPoint
  - MS Teams
  - Email

## Usefulness of CTs During Decision-Making

- **Benefits:**
  - Enhance collaboration across different locations and time zones.
  - Provide platforms for documenting decisions and tracking progress.
  - Support both real-time and delayed communication, catering to various needs.

- **Challenges:**
  - Ensuring all team members are proficient with the tools.
  - Managing information overload.
  - Maintaining data security and privacy.
