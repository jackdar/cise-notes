## Tony's Views on Software Engineering

### Reflecting Over Time

- Contributions to ACM Inroads magazine as a columnist and associate editor.
- Reflections on software development practices and education.

### Software Engineering Tensions

- **Core Questions:**
  - Difference between programming-in-the-small vs. programming-in-the-large.
  - Is programming merely the implementation of a design?

- **Opposing Forces in Software Development:**
  1. A force for change based on an evolving vision driving the software process.
  2. Commercial need for certainty in cost and outcomes.
  3. Project management's focus on delivering against targets.
  4. Professional commitment to delivering quality software.

### Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

- **Principles:**
  - Delivering scheduled releases on regular cycles.
  - Improved client relationships by allowing priority adjustments.
  - Constant delivery helps estimate feature costs and control project scope.
  - Time-boxing forces tough decisions and maintains project momentum.

### Documentation in Agile Methods

- **Theory Building View:**
  - Programming as developing a shared "theory of the world" within the team.
  - Code is the primary artifact encapsulating this theory.

- **Role of Documentation:**
  - Secondary to the team's internalized understanding.
  - Necessary for communication and understanding.
  - Two primary reasons for documentation:
    - To communicate.
    - To understand.

## Working Globally in Software Engineering

### Developing as a Professional Software Engineer

- Importance of understanding software development in a global context.
- Encouraging broader thinking beyond individual coding tasks.
- Reflecting on student conceptions of the discipline.

## Dispositions and Agility

### Agility as a Disposition

- **Core Principle from Agile Manifesto:**
  - "Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."

- **Key Aspects of Agile Development:**
  1. Customer satisfaction.
  2. Delivery of working software.
  3. Provision of value.

- **Mindset and Attitudinal Dimensions:**
  - Agility involves how people are disposed to use their abilities.
  - Raises the question of whether dispositions can be taught or are innate.

### Teaching Agility

- Importance of discretion and judgment in providing value to the client.
- Teams internalizing values to decide which tasks contribute to value.
- Recognizing that not all traditional deliverables make sense in every context.

## DevOps, Agility, and Leadership Attributes

### Dispositions in DevOps Roles

- Dispositions differ from knowledge and skills.
- Emphasis on flexibility, adaptability, and collaborative mindset.
- Desired attributes include customer awareness, relationship management, communication skills, and respect in collaborative relationships.

### Leadership Attributes

- **Transformational Leadership Roles:**
  - Mentor, Facilitator, Innovator, Broker.
  - Contrast with transactional roles focused on tasks.

- **Expectations:**
  - Taking responsibility for team members.
  - Training and mentoring others to develop new skills and capabilities.
