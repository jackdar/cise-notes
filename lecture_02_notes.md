### Team Development

#### Preparing for Team Development

- **Key Questions:**
  - What decisions, actions, and plans are needed to start developing and deploying features as a team?
  - What types of work need preparation?

### Ideas and Approaches

- **Traditional Waterfall Approach:**
  - Linear phases: Requirements → Design → Build → Test → Deploy → Maintain.

### Types of Work in Software Development

- **Common Work Areas:**
  - Understanding the problem.
  - Planning the work.
  - Designing the solution.
  - Executing the work.
  - Delivering/deploying the solution.
  - Maintaining/updating the work.

- **SEMAT (Software Engineering Methods and Theory):**
  - Focus on key elements like opportunity, stakeholders, requirements, software system, team, way of working, and work.

### Iterative and Incremental Development

- **Agile Principles:**
  - Close collaboration with users and clients.
  - Shared product goal or vision.
  - Iterative and incremental development for rapid learning and feedback.
  - Frequent delivery of small value increments.
  - Breaking down problems and solutions into manageable parts.

- **User Stories and Backlogs:**
  - Creating user stories and story maps.
  - Maintaining a product backlog of requirements.
  - Setting iteration and sprint goals.

### Engaging with the Client

#### Talking to the Product Owner (PO)

- **Goals:**
  - Understand the problem, why it's a problem, and desired changes.
  - Develop a product goal statement.

- **Principles:**
  - Ask open-ended questions.
  - Practice active listening.
  - Stay focused on the problem space.
  - Document discussions to form user stories.
  - Break down the problem into epic user stories.

#### Active Listening

- **Techniques:**
  - Fully engage and pay attention.
  - Reflect and paraphrase to confirm understanding.
  - Avoid interruptions and personal biases.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Process:**
  - Developers modify code locally and commit changes to a local repository.
  - Push changes to a shared GitHub repository.
  - Automated tests and code checks run before merging.
  - Continuous integration happens every few hours.

- **Tools:**
  - Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
  - CI servers or services to automate testing and integration.

#### Continuous Deployment (CD)

- **Overview:**
  - Automates the release process to deploy code to production.
  - Ensures frequent and reliable deployment of updates.

### Requirements Engineering in Agile

- **Iterative Approach:**
  - Requirements are refined incrementally.
  - Emphasis on flexibility and adapting to change.

### Historical Perspective

#### Iterative Enhancement (1975 and Earlier)

- **Concept:**
  - Start with a simple implementation of a subproblem.
  - Use a project control list to track tasks and progress.
  - Iteratively enhance the implementation until completion.

### Agile Requirements Refinery

- **Application in Software Product Management:**
  - Applying Scrum principles to manage and refine requirements.
  - Emphasis on collaboration and adaptability.

### DevOps as a Way of Working (WoW)

- **Values:**
  - Frequent deployment and release.
  - Team ownership of the product lifecycle.
  - Accountability for deployment and post-release performance.

- **Enablers:**
  - Test automation and CI/CD automation.
  - Infrastructure as code.
  - Monitoring and alerting systems.
  - Practices like rollback strategies, feature flags, and microservices.

### Technology Stacks and Full-Stack Development

#### Importance of a Tech Stack

- **Considerations:**
  - Aligns with project goals and team expertise.
  - Impacts scalability, maintainability, and performance.

#### MNNN Stack Overview

- **Components:**
  - **MongoDB:** NoSQL document database.
  - **Nest.js:** Backend framework built on Node.js.
  - **Next.js:** React framework for server-rendered apps.
  - **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.

- **Architecture:**
  - Layered structure separating concerns.
  - Supports scalable and maintainable applications.

#### Alternative Stack: MERN

- **Components:**
  - **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js.**
  - Popular for full-stack JavaScript applications.

### Agile Values and Practices

#### Agile Manifesto

- **Core Values:**
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  - Responding to change over following a plan.

#### Modern Agile

- **Key Principles:**
  - Make people awesome.
  - Deliver value continuously.
  - Experiment and learn rapidly.
  - Make safety a prerequisite.

#### Heart of Agile
