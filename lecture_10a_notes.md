### Formal Definition

- **Jansen, Finkelstein, and Brinkkemper (2009):**
  - _"A set of businesses functioning as a unit and interacting with a shared market for software and services, together with the relationships among them. These relationships are frequently underpinned by a common technological platform or market and operate through the exchange of information, resources, and artifacts."_
