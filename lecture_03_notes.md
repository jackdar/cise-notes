## Scrum/Iterative Workflow

![Scrum Workflow](https://www.scrum.org/resources)

- **What should we do BEFORE we can start Sprint 1?**
  - Well-thought-out items: **Do these next**
  - Still a bit vague: **Do these later**

---

## Introduction on How to Write User Stories

[Video: Introduction on How to Write User Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn-QMvDTuEY)

- Perspectives and purposes:
  - Design Lead Developer
  - Client or Product Owner
  - Sales Manager
  - Business Analyst
- There are many perspectives and purposes.

---

## Pre-Sprint – User Requirements v1

![Scrum Diagram](https://www.scrum.org/resources)

- **What do users want to be able to do to achieve the product goal?**
- **User Stories:**
  - As a `<user type>`, I want to `<do something>` so that `<benefit>`.
- **Product Goal (Outcome wanted):**
  - Make it front of mind for the team.
- **Business Problem or Opportunity:**
  - What needs to change?
  - Why is this product worth doing?

---

### User Stories Part 1

- **Placeholders for Conversations**
- **Significant User Type:**
  - Characteristics that distinguish from other user types that may affect the design.
  - Not just "User".
- **Capability:**
  - The new capability the user wants to reach a smaller goal (outcome).
  - In business language; no solution details.
- **Goal:**
  - What is the desired outcome of this new user capability?

---

**Example User Story:**

- As a **researcher**, I want to be able to **recommend articles to include in the evidence repository** so that **the evidence available keeps expanding**.

---

- **Additional Insights:**
  - I want people to be able to add new evidence so the repository gets bigger and leverage crowd sourcing.
  - As a practitioner, I want lots of evidence to be available so the evidence is convincing.
  - As the Product Owner, I want to have lots of articles in the evidence repository.
  - We should check:
    - The article is about SE with evidence (relevance).
    - The article is not already in the repository (avoid duplicates).
    - The quality of the evidence in the article (quality).
  - The submitter should be informed/thanked if the article they submitted is accepted or not (and why not).

---

## Discovering Product Goal and User Needs

- Knowledge about the problem, user needs, and possible solutions is distributed unevenly—especially at the start.
- **There are many perspectives on the problem and user needs:**
  - Lead Developer
  - Client or Product Owner
  - Sales Manager
  - Business Analyst
- **Different worldviews and language**

---

## If You Just Imagine the User Needs from Your Perspective!

*(Insert relevant image or cartoon illustrating misaligned perspectives.)*

---

## Documenting User Needs/Requirements – User Stories

- More detailed user stories with at least one acceptance criterion.
- Keep breaking down until you expect that the user story will take 1–2 ideal days and definitely less than 1 sprint.
- Work out technical tasks that need to be done on the next set of user stories to be worked on.
- Often tasks are associated with user stories.
- Avoid technical "user stories".

## Specification by Example

- **We will come back to this.**

| Order Amount | VIP Member | Number of Items in Order | Free Freight | Order Discount |
|--------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| \<$100       | Yes        | \>=10                    | No           | Yes            |
| \>=$100      | Yes        | \<10                     | Yes          | No             |
| \<$100       | No         | \>=10                    | No           | No             |
| \>=$100      | No         | \<10                     | No           | No             |

## Discovering User Stories (User Requirements)

- **User Story Workshops:**
  - Product stakeholders, Product Owner, Business Analyst, Developer, Tester, etc.
  - Stakeholders write them and group (and agree on order or in/out).
- **Methods:**
  - Interviewing users or the Product Owner.
  - Observation, surveys, impact mapping, customer journey mapping.
- **Approaches:**
  - Big upfront effort vs. Iterative and incremental effort.
    - Plan-driven control based on high-confidence, long-term predictions.
    - Frequent opportunity for changes based on empiricism and short learning loops.

---

## Discovering User Stories – Mapping Techniques

- **Mapping = Visualizing information showing relationships and structure.**
- Helps to make sense of something and acts as an information radiator.
- **Types of Mapping:**
  - Customer Journey Maps
  - Impact Mapping
  - Value Stream Mapping
- Explore these methods yourself.

---

## Customer Journey Maps

- **Definition:**
  - A visual representation of the important steps a customer goes through to achieve a goal with your company.
- **Benefits:**
  - Understand customers' motivations, needs, and pain points.
- **Quote:**
  - "A successful customer journey map will give you real insight into what your customers want and any parts of your product, brand, or process that aren't delivering." — David Weaver

---

## Characteristics of a Good User Story and How to Write Them

- **Independent:** Minimize dependencies that require coordination.
- **Negotiable:** Not a contract; open to discussion.
- **Valuable:** Written from the user's perspective in non-technical language.
- **Estimable:** Can be estimated for effort and time.
- **Small:** Should be small enough to be completed within a sprint.
- **Testable:** Must have acceptance criteria to verify completion.

*(We will revisit this after Sprint 1.)*

---

## Story Maps are the New Product Backlog

- **Story Mapping:** Structuring product features (as user stories) to model the entire product.
- **Advantages Over Product Backlog:**
  - Avoids shortcomings of a prioritized list.
  - Useful for planning delivery product increments and sprint planning.
  - Supports upfront product design and work prioritization.
  - Helps share and develop understanding.

---

## Addressing the Need with Story Maps

![Story Map Example](https://www.slideshare.net/versionone/story-mapping-in-a-nutshell/6-the_problems_with_flat_backlogstraditional)

- Provides context for features to understand relationships between features, user types, and their purpose.

## Using a Story Map to Slice Out a Delivery Plan or Sprint Plan

![Story Map Slicing](https://www.scrumalliance.org/system/slides/118/original/christianhossa_specificationbyexamplewithgherkin.pdf?1349824954)

---

## Anatomy of a Story Map

![Anatomy of a Story Map](https://agilevelocity.com/story-mapping-101/)

- **Columns:** Relate to user activities.
- **Horizontal Slices:** Group by priority, importance, or frequency of use.
- Each column has system features related to the user activity.
- Create horizontal slices to represent the scope of delivery cycles or sprint cycles.

## Tools for Story Mapping

- Various tools are available to create and manage story maps.
- Explore options to find what works best for your team.

---

## User Story Success Criteria

- A list of rules or criteria that should be met for the story to be successful.
- Also known as acceptance criteria, acceptance tests, or conditions of satisfaction.
- **Common Template:**
  - **Given** [initial context], **When** [event occurs], **Then** [outcome].

---

## Exercise: Write Down Two User Stories About SPEED

- Use the [Padlet link](https://padlet.com/tony_clear/speed-user-stories-8paqocdeblzf3ro4).
- In teams of four, select the best one.
- In pairs, select the best two.

---

## Importance of User Stories

- Focus on understanding the business value from the user's perspective.
- Delays the temptation for developers to jump to solutions before understanding the problem.
- Helps the user (Product Owner) clarify what they want.
- Makes it easy to verify requirements and ensures shared understanding.

---

## User Stories in a Nutshell

- **User Stories:**
  - Defer detail until the development team needs it.
  - Act as a reminder to have conversations and ask questions.
- **Short Feedback Cycles:**
  - Development team learns from doing.
  - Product Owner learns from seeing.
  - Requirements emerge and change.

---

## Skills and Mindset Needed

- Writing effective user stories.
- Deferring detail appropriately.
- Asking questions to get necessary detail.
- Writing acceptance tests and conditions of satisfaction.
- Splitting user stories as needed.
- Understanding user value and creating personas.
- Managing changes and estimation.

---

## Be Sensitive to Your User Task's "Altitude"

*(Adapted from Alistair Cockburn's Writing Effective Use Cases)*

- **Functional or "Sea Level":**
  - Tasks expected to be completed in a single sitting.
- **Sub-Functional or "Fish Level":**
  - Small tasks that don't mean much alone; several are done before reaching a functional goal.
- **Activity or "Kite Level":**
  - Longer-term goals with no precise ending; several functional tasks performed in this context.

---

## Three Key Pieces of Information in User Stories

1. **Primary Actor/User Role/Persona:**
   - Who is the requirement for?
2. **Action/Feature/Goal:**
   - What is the new functionality the user wants?
3. **Reason/Benefit:**
   - Why does the user want this requirement? What is the expected benefit?

---

## Examples of User Stories

- As a **registered user**, I want to **cancel my order** so that **I can change my mind**.
- As a **job seeker**, I want my **CV to be easily available to employers** so that **I maximize my chances of being offered a job**.

---

## Software Requirements are a Communication Challenge

- User stories are placeholders for requirements.
- Analysis spans the entire lifetime of the deliverable.
- They are complete units that can be built, tested, and delivered.
- **Benefits of Getting User Stories Right:**
  - Set boundaries for each work item.
  - Unit for planning sprints and estimation.
  - Keep track of what is still to be done and in what order.
  - Basis for testing, monitoring progress, change management, and division of labor.

---

## Developer Task vs. User Story

- **Task-Oriented:** Create a database to store job seekers' CVs.
- **User Story-Oriented:** As a **job seeker**, I want my **CV to be easily available to employers** so that **I maximize my chances of being offered a job**.

---

## Breaking Down User Stories

- **Why?**
  - For planning, estimation, independent work splitting, and testing.
- **How?**
  - Workflow steps
  - Business rule variations
  - Major effort extraction
  - Simple vs. complex versions

---

## Developer Tasks to Create Features

- **Why?**
  - To estimate effort.
  - To involve the right technical specialties.
  - To plan development in the sprint.
- **Examples:**
  - Create database schema.
  - Integrate with backend services.
  - Develop frontend components.

---

## Self-Organizing Teams in Agile

- The team agrees on:
  - Acceptance criteria (conditions of satisfaction).
  - Proposed solution approach.
  - Estimate of effort.
- **Do we need a team leader?**
  - Teams are self-organizing; leadership can be shared.

---

## Creating User Stories

- Anyone can write user stories—team members, Product Owner, stakeholders.
- The Product Owner ensures a Product Backlog exists and is ordered.
- Everyone should be involved in discussions about user stories.
- Acceptance criteria should be written as part of the user story.

---

## Users Come First

- Avoid speculating or imagining what users want.
- If you don't know who the users and customers are and why they would use the product, conduct necessary user research first (e.g., observations, interviews).

---

## Create Stories Collaboratively

- Involve the team and stakeholders.
- Use workshops and collaborative sessions.
- Ensure shared understanding and buy-in.

---

## Personas Lead to the Right Stories

- **Define Personas:**
  - Create detailed profiles of typical users.
- **Ask:**
  - What functionality should the product provide to meet the goals of the personas?

---

## Adding Detail to a User Story

- **When?**
  - When it is near the top of the Product Backlog.
- **How?**
  - Breaking stories down into smaller pieces.
  - Adding acceptance tests or criteria.

---

## Acceptance Criteria as Details

- **Conditions of Satisfaction:**
  - Specific requirements that must be met for the story to be considered complete.
- **Example:**
  - As a registered user, I want to cancel my order so that I can change my mind.
    - Acceptance Criteria:
      - The user can cancel an order within 24 hours.
      - A confirmation email is sent upon cancellation.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance, security, usability, etc., that are critical to the product's success.
- Should be considered when writing user stories and acceptance criteria.

---

## User Stories About UI

- Focus on the user's interaction with the system.
- May include mockups or wireframes to illustrate the desired interface.

---

## Breaking Down User Stories

- **Techniques:**
  - By workflow steps.
  - By business rules.
  - By major effort areas.
  - By simple vs. complex implementations.

*(Refer to Leffingwell, D. (2011). *Agile Software Requirements*, p. 135–136.)*

---

## Definition of Ready

- **Criteria for a User Story to be Ready:**
  - Shared understanding among key stakeholders.
  - Conveys the opportunity, issue, need, or value.
  - Title is short and conveys the deliverable.
  - Delivers an atomic increment in business value.
  - Can be completed in a sprint.
  - Has sufficient acceptance criteria.
  - The team can estimate the story.
