---

## Overview

- Discussion on Large Language Models (LLMs) and the recent hype around generative AI and ChatGPT.
- Exploration of profound questions around data, rights, and ownership claims.
- Critical view on how these claims might be perceived by computing educators and students.

---

## Waves of Colonization

- **Third Wave of Colonization:**
  - Google as the vanguard of a new colonization wave for countries like New Zealand.
  - **First Wave:** By empire and the gun.
  - **Second Wave:** By the dollar and economic might.
  - **Third Wave:** Shaping discourse through distorted delivery of information.
- Questioning whether LLMs and generative AI represent an extension of this third wave or something radically different.

---

## Surveillance Capitalism

- **Concept Introduced by Shoshana Zuboff:**
  - Strategies adopted by big tech companies.
  - Appropriating rights to new forms of data.
  - Expansion into the realm of big data.
  - The economic shift known as "surveillance capitalism".

---

### Life as Data

- **Big Data:**
  - Constituted by capturing small data from individuals' computer-mediated actions.
  - Individuals' activities in pursuit of effective life are commodified.
- Big tech companies accumulate surveillance assets, capital, and rights.
- This accumulation is achieved through unilateral declarations resembling pre-modern absolutist authority.

---

### Who Decides?

- **Calculated Secrecy:**
  - Concealment of new political equations where companies like Google override users' decision rights.
  - Comparison to King Kong shooing away an ant.
- These actions occur offstage, away from public scrutiny.

---

## Colonization Through Language

- **Use of Euphemisms:**
  - Historical labeling of indigenous peoples as "heathens," "infidels," etc.
  - Such language deletes native peoples from moral and legal considerations.
- Legitimizes acts of taking and breaking that pave the way for control.

---

### A New Colony?

- New Zealand frames itself as a "small, advanced economy."
- Assertion that citizens are becoming newly colonized through digital means.

---

## Neo-Digi-Colonization

- **Mechanisms:**
  - How AI and LLM controllers usurp our places and claims.
- **Strategy:**
  - "Move fast and break things" mentality prioritizing speed and greed over sense.

---

### Speed Over Care

- **High-Stakes AI Research:**
  - Data work is undervalued and seen as low-level grunt work.
  - Incentive structures encourage rapid development over careful scientific work.

*Reference:*
- Liesenfeld, A., Lopez, A., & Dingemanse, M. (2023). Opening up ChatGPT: Tracking openness, transparency, and accountability in instruction-tuned text generators. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.05532*.

---

### The Need for Openness

- **Argument for Openness:**
  - Greater transparency in the field of instruction-tuned large language models is necessary.
- **Findings:**
  - Projects vary in implementation, documentation, and usability.
  - Many offer access to source code and some pre-training data, sometimes in legally ambiguous ways.

---

### Openness and ChatGPT

- **ChatGPT's Approach:**
  - Announced via a company blog post.
  - Rolled out to the public without technical documentation.
  - Designed to capture free human labor.
- **Issue of Free Labor:**
  - Historical marker of colonization.

## Land and Property Claims

- **Appropriation of Data as Land:**
  - Drawing parallels between data appropriation and land claims.
- **Mechanisms Based on Roman Law:**
  - **Occupation:** Claiming what belongs to no one (terra nullius).
  - **Conquest**
  - **Cession (by treaty)**

*Reference:*
- Simpson, G. (1993). Mabo, international law, terra nullius and the stories of settlement: an unresolved jurisprudence. *Melbourne University Law Review*, 19, 195.

---

### Doctrine of Discovery

- **Historical Context:**
  - Sanction from the Catholic Church for European colonization.
  - Legal justification for occupation of newly discovered territories.
- **Papal Bulls:**
  - Decrees issued starting in 1452.
  - Authorized seizure of lands and subjugation of non-Christian peoples.

---

### Doctrine Repudiated

- **Recent Developments:**
  - Vatican repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery in March 2023.
  - Acknowledged that the mindset of cultural or racial superiority has been renounced.
- **Continued Impact:**
  - Legal basis for land ownership in settler societies still relies on the doctrine.

*Reference:*
- Chappell, B. (2023). The Vatican repudiates 'Doctrine of Discovery,' which was used to justify colonialism. *NPR*.

---

### Terra Nullius in Australia

- **Critique by Simpson:**
  - Tweaking of the definition of "terra nullius" in Australia.
  - Judicial decisions rewriting international law and common law.
- **Implications:**
  - Original inhabitants face injustice due to legal mysticism.

*Reference:*
- Simpson, G. (1993). *Melbourne University Law Review*, 19, 195.

---

## AI and Property Rights

- **Data as the New Land:**
  - Appropriation of data libraries and internet scrapings by LLM creators.
- **Legal Challenges:**
  - How AI and LLMs lay implicit territorial claims on data.
- **Potential for Intellectual Property Disputes:**
  - Major battles over intellectual property rights are anticipated.

---

### AI and Copyright

- **Ownership Issues:**
  - Uncertainty over who owns content generated by AI.
- **Legal Perspectives:**
  - In New Zealand, computer-generated work is protected under copyright for 50 years.
- **Risks for Users:**
  - Users may face legal issues for content generated or used via AI systems.

## Data Privacy Protection – ACM TechBrief

- **Problem:**
  - Easy to piece together private information from public data.
  - Controls over information privacy are increasingly ineffective.
- **Policy Implications:**
  - Need for regulation to mitigate risks of private information disclosure.
  - Traditional anonymization methods are insufficient.

---

## Colonization—Old and New Strategies

- **Parallels:**
  - Strategies for colonization are mirrored in modern data appropriation.
- **Mindsets:**
  - Cultural and racial superiority justifying the taking of data without permission.

---

## Regulatory Race

- **Need for Regulation:**
  - To assert human rights and protect data privacy.
- **Examples:**
