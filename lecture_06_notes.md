## Information Technology Perspectives

- **Multiple Discipline Perspectives:**
  - **Computational View:** Technology as algorithm (Computer Science).
  - **Tool View:** Technology as labor substitution or productivity tool (Commercial Perspective).
  - **Proxy View:** Technology as perception or diffusion (Information Systems).
  - **Ensemble View:** Technology as development project, production network, embedded system, and structure.

## Power and Technology

- **Quotes:**
  - Designers have significant power in specifying systems.
  - Decisions in design can reduce or eliminate action alternatives.
- **Implications:**
  - Systems can extend managerial power and control.
  - The way technology is appropriated can be unpredictable.

## Professional Responsibilities

- **Computing Professionals:**
  - Actions change the world; must reflect on wider impacts.
  - Should consistently support the public good.
- **ACM Code of Ethics:**
  - Expresses the conscience of the profession.
  - [ACM Code of Ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/)

## What is Ethics?

- **Definitions:**
  - **Society:** Ordered community of people.
  - **Morality:** Division between right and wrong actions.
  - **Ethics:** Standards of what is believed to be right and wrong.
- **Why Study Ethics?**
  - Address new problems (cyberbullying, privacy, spam).
  - Common sense may not be adequate.

## Cyberethics

- **Unique Ethical Challenges:**
  - Policy vacuums due to malleability of computers.
  - Evolving issues with technological advancements.
- **Evolution Phases:**
  - Stand-alone machines to interconnected networks.
  - Emergence of AI and autonomous systems.

## Philosophical Ethics

- **Ethical Theories:**
  - **Consequentialism:** Actions judged by outcomes.
    - **Egoism:** Individual's interests above all.
    - **Utilitarianism:** Greatest good for the greatest number.
    - **Altruism:** Actions favorable to all except the actor.
  - **Deontology:** Actions judged by adherence to rules or duties.

- **Ethical Mindset:**
  - "The unexamined life is not worth living." — Socrates
  - Eudaimonism: Pursuit of a fulfilling and virtuous life.

## Moral Dilemmas and AI Ethics

- **Crowd Ethics:**
  - Platforms like [Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu) explore ethical decisions in autonomous systems.
- **Challenges:**
  - Programming ethics into AI.
  - Issues with machine learning biases.

## Professional Ethics

- **What is a Profession?**
  - Requires expert knowledge, autonomy, and a code of conduct.
  - Professionals have significant social effects.

- **Codes of Ethics:**
  - Provide guidelines for professional behavior.
  - Examples: Medical (NZMA), Engineering (REA), Legal (NZLS), IT (IT Professionals NZ).

  1. Good faith
  2. Integrity
  3. Community focus
  4. Skills
  5. Continuous development
  6. Informed consent
  7. Managed conflicts of interest
  8. Competence

### IEEE-CS Software Engineering Code of Ethics

## Strengths and Weaknesses of Professional Codes

- **Strengths:**
  - Inspire ethical behavior, guide decisions, educate members, discipline violations, inform the public, sensitize to issues, enhance professional image.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - Directives can be vague or conflicting, not exhaustive, may lack enforcement, and sometimes serve self-interest.

## Conflict of Professional Responsibility

- **Whistle-Blowing:**
  - Exposing illegal or unethical activities within an organization.
  - Ethical dilemma between loyalty to employer and public interest.

- **Case Study:**
  - Challenger Disaster (1986)
    - Engineers aware of safety risks but were overruled.
    - Should they have gone public?

- **Guidance:**
  - Professional codes offer some direction but may be vague.
  - De George's criteria for whistle-blowing:
    - Morally permitted if harm is serious, concerns reported internally, internal channels exhausted.
    - Morally obligated if there's evidence and belief that going public will bring change.

## Project Risk and Software Development Impact Statements (SoDIS)
