  - Builds trust and generates new ideas.
  - Networking with colleagues worldwide.

## Planning the Work

### Pre-Conference Activities

- **Preparatory Steps:**
  - Think about preparatory activities.
  - Design and allocate tasks to members.
  - Prepare protocols and instruments (e.g., questionnaires).
  - Arrange ethics protocols.
  - Collect examples and review selected literature.
  - Analyze data sets.

### During the Conference

- **Collaborative Work:**
  - Take stock of preparatory work completed.
  - Agree on an agenda and plan.
  - Share contact details and conference commitments.
  - Draft structure for the report.
  - Divide work and operate in parallel.

### Post-Conference Activities

- **Finalizing the Report:**
  - Allocate responsibility for the final draft.
  - Share timetables considering holidays and commitments.
  - Work on the final draft with version tracking.
  - Submit for reviews and make necessary changes.
  - Submit the camera-ready copy.

## The Current Working Group's Progress

### Planning the Work – Pre-Conference

- **Preparatory Activities:**
  - Leaders initiated the project and data collection in Sweden, UK, and NZ.
  - Members selected from various countries (NZ, Australia, Scotland, UK, Norway, Sweden, US, Cyprus, Canada).

- **Subgroups Established:**
  - Literature Review
  - Data Analysis
  - Practitioner Impacts
  - Competencies

- **Protocols and Ethics:**
  - Designed and prepared interview protocols.
  - Arranged human subjects ethics protocols at respective institutions.
  - Developed data sharing agreement.

- **Data Collection:**
  - Conducted interviews via Zoom and MS Teams.
  - Utilized automatic transcription services.
  - Managed challenges with time zones and connectivity.

- **Literature Review and Data Analysis:**
  - Subgroups allocated specific tasks.
  - Established a secure central repository (UU - ALLVIS).
  - Developed a data analysis protocol.

### Data Analysis Strategy

- **Protocol Development:**
  - Consulted literature on protocol templates (Brereton et al., 2008; King et al., 2018; Stol and Fitzgerald, 2014).
  - Adopted steps from Eisenhardt (1989) for case study analysis.

- **Template Analysis:**
  - Employed thematic analysis as per King et al. (2018).
  - Steps include familiarization, preliminary coding, clustering, developing initial template, and refining.

- **Work Allocation:**
  - Distributed coding tasks among working group members.
  - Considered pair coding strategies and subgroup assignments.

## Competencies Framework

- **CC2020 Project Curriculum Directions:**
  - A framework for structuring competency-related responses.

- **Competency Components:**
  - **Knowledge:** "Know-what" dimension; factual information.
  - **Skills:** "Know-how" dimension; develops over time with practice.
  - **Dispositions:** "Know-why" dimension; character or quality in task performance.
  - **Task:** Frames the skilled application of knowledge.

- **Expressing Competencies:**
  - Competencies expressed at the level of entire Knowledge Areas (KAs).
  - Focus on collections of topics and learning outcomes observable in tasks.

### Sample Competency Statement

- **Example:**
  - Competency statements include knowledge, skills, and dispositions.
  - Align with tasks relevant to graduates or professionals.

## Early Insights from the Working Group

- **Current Observations:**
  - Early stages in understanding AI's impact on competencies.
  - Variable acceptance and adoption among professionals.
  - Range from outright bans to enthusiastic incorporation.
  - Active experimentation and pilot studies due to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
  - Vendor-guided adoptions, e.g., Microsoft Copilot.

## Implications for Teaching Software Engineering

### Shift in Interaction Models

- **Dialogic Model:**
  - Moving towards conversational interactions with systems.
  - Importance of prompt engineering and strategy refinement.
  - Easy implementation of backend chatbots using APIs (e.g., Vercel).

- **Educational Considerations:**
  - Addressing various forms of academic dishonesty.
  - Shifting towards acceptable and valuable behaviors.
  - Developing judgment and handling of reviews and errors.
  - Understanding hallucinations as an inherent design of LLM technology.
  - Coexisting with generative AI services.
  - Redesigning courses and assessments accordingly.

### Ethical and Practical Challenges

- **Cheating and Integrity:**
  - Dealing with cheating facilitated by AI tools.
  - Observed violations of service agreements.
  - Privacy and intellectual property rights concerns.

- **Accessibility and Bias:**
  - Cost and accessibility issues of commercial AI services.
  - Awareness of embedded biases in AI systems.
  - Emphasizing ethical considerations in education.

## Academic Integrity Updates

- **Evolving Policies:**
  - Changes in academic guidelines to address AI-generated content.
  - Updated referencing and citation standards for AI tools.

- **Terms of Use Considerations:**
  - Understanding the terms of services like OpenAI's policies.
  - Restrictions on representing AI-generated output as human-generated.

## Broader Implications

- **Data Privacy Concerns:**
  - Risks of contributing data to large AI models.
  - Comparisons to science fiction analogies like the Borg from Star Trek.

## Conclusion

- **Summary:**
  - Discussed the ITiCSE working groups and their significance.
  - Explored the implications of generative AI for IT professionals and competencies.
  - Outlined the working group's progress and data analysis strategy.
  - Defined competencies from the CC2020 perspective.
  - Shared early insights and tentative implications for teaching software engineering.
